# The Lounge Midnight Theme
## A theme made for The Lounge, an IRC Network.
---
I didn't like either of the default themes for The Lounge when joining for the SCP Wiki, so I created my own! Feel free to use it by copy-pasting the CSS from midnight.css into the custom theme field in the IRC!

### To Implement The Code:

1. Navigate to the "settings" icon in the bottom left of the screen.

2. Navigate to "Appearance".

3. Scroll down to "Custom Stylesheet" and paste the code.
